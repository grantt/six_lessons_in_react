## Lesson 1 - Basics
Introduce basic React components by building a "Hello World" component that has a render method returning JSX. Next we introduce the concept of component properties, default properties, as well as how to render a component in the DOM. Finally, component state and event handlers are introduced.
### Exercises
Hello World Component

## Lesson 2 - Flux and Data
Flux architecture is introduced along with the idea of unidirectional data flow. The Fluxxor implementation of Flux is used for these examples. Actions and stores are introduced to demonstrate the proper construction of data flow. Next, we provide an example of an asynchronous call for data and how they are handled by actions within the Flux paradigm.
