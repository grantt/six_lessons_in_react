    <h1>Lesson 4</h1>
    <div id="container">
      <p>In this lesson we're going to talk about React controller-views. Controller-views in React are typically at the top of a hierarchy of views. They are responsible for listening to changes in state and passing the new data down to their children.</p>

      <p>When new data arrives from the store, the controller-view sets its own state, which triggers a re-rendering of themselves and all of their children components.</p> 

      <p>In order to familiarize ourselves with this concept, let's add a top nav and sidebar to our app. We want the top nav and sidebar to interact like they do in <a href="http://dillinger.io">dillinger.io</a>. So our controller-view in this exercise will be responsible for listening for changes in the state of the page and re-render the sidebar and top nav based on that. The primary piece of information we want to keep as the state is whether or not the sidebar is open.</p>

      <p>So let's start with a simple and minimally styled top nav component. Feel free to implement it as you wish. But here's the top nav we came up with:</p>

      <pre><code>var TopNav = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return(
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;i className="fa-times" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;My Awesome Markdown preview generator&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    );
  }
});</code></pre>

    <div id="footerNav">
